## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Set-up. 
```{r}

#Load packages
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)

#Load in dataframes. This data comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) Federal Reporting Services. This data is for the years 2017 through 2021.
water_system_summary <- read_csv("Water System Summary.csv")
all_violations <- read_csv("Violation Report.csv")

#Link to data: https://sdwis.epa.gov/ords/sfdw_pub/f?p=108:200:::::: 


```


#Find out which public water systems have had stage 1 and stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts violations. 
```{r}
disinfectant_violations <- all_violations %>% filter(`Rule Name`=="Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule"|`Rule Name`=="Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule")

#1307 disinfectant violations in the last four years. 
```


#Group these violations by public water system, and find out how many unique violations each public water system has. 
```{r}
#First, lets make a new column that creates a unique identifier for each violation.
disinfectant_violations <- disinfectant_violations %>% mutate(unique_id = str_c(`Violation First Reported Date`,"/",`Violation Type`,"/",`Contaminant Name`))

#Making a table)
disinfectant_violations_by_pws <- disinfectant_violations %>% group_by(`PWS Name`) %>% summarise(unique_id = n()) %>% arrange(desc(unique_id))

```


#Now make a table showing how many of each TYPE of violation each public water system has. 
```{r}
 disinfectant_violations_by_pws_and_violation_type <- disinfectant_violations %>% group_by(`PWS Name`,`Violation Type`) %>% summarise(unique_id = n()) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = `Violation Type`,values_from = unique_id) %>% arrange(desc(`Maximum Contaminant Level Violation, Average`))

```


#Now I want to know where these violations are concentrated. Does one county or region stand out? First let's figure out the raw number of disinfectant violations per county. 
```{r}
#First,we will have to join in a new dataframe that connects public water system names to the counties and cities they are in. 
names_counties_water_systems <- read_csv("names_counties_water_systems.csv")

disinfectant_violations_by_pws_geographic <- left_join(disinfectant_violations_by_pws,names_counties_water_systems)


#Now let's find the total number of disinfectant violations for each county and city. 
disinfectant_violations_by_county <- disinfectant_violations_by_pws_geographic %>% group_by(`Counties Served`) %>% summarise(total_disinfectant_violations = sum(unique_id)) %>% arrange(desc(total_disinfectant_violations))

disinfectant_violations_by_city <- disinfectant_violations_by_pws_geographic %>% group_by(`Cities Served`) %>% summarise(total_disinfectant_violations = sum(unique_id)) %>% arrange(desc(total_disinfectant_violations))


```

#Now we'll have to adjust this data per capita. I'm going to do violations / 1,000 people served.
```{r}


disinfectant_violations_by_pws_geographic_2 <- disinfectant_violations_by_pws_geographic %>% group_by(`Counties Served`) %>% summarise(population_served = sum(`PopulationServed Count`))

left_join (disinfectant_violations_by_county,disinfectant_violations_by_pws_geographic_2) %>% mutate(violations_per_thousand_served = (total_disinfectant_violations/ population_served)*1000) %>% arrange(desc(violations_per_thousand_served))

```




#Mapping this would be helpful. But it definitely seems to be concentrated in poorest, rural counties. Durham throws me. Maybe it is a poverty thing? Many parts of Durham are inhabitated by low-income POC. 



#Follow up data questions

#How long are each of these compliance periods? We want to know the frequency at which a group gets violations. (If they are every two months and you have gotten 24 violations in four years, you have gotten violations every time.  


#What's the typical size of systems with frequent failures? Do we see a correlation between number of violations and size of population served, somehow?

#Do we see a link between type of system and number of violations?


#Is there a link to the number of violations and the number of concentrated animal feeding operations?

#Is there a link to the number of violations and the incidence of certain hospital visits and diseases? 

#Should we focus on one particularly heinous disinfecant? Or one that is most common? 

#Follow Up Reporting questions
#What's the punishment
#What does each of these violations mean? For the maximum contaminant violations, look up individual violations and see by how much it exceeded the recommended levels. 
#Who is responsible
#What has been done to fix this
#Who has been affected
#How is it harming them
